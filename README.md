## About

OSAVA is an application that allows users to visualize various Operating System algorithms.

## Description

The Operating System Algorithms Visualization App has been developed to help students learn the different types of algorithms used in operating systems. Standard versions of the algorithms, as given in Silberschatz et al. (2012), have been followed.

The different variants and all parameters of the algorithms have been considered. The visualizations follow the concepts and notations used in Silberschatz et al. (2012). The user interface of the app has been kept simple and interactive.

The application is available for both Desktop and Android.

## Built With

* Python 2.7
